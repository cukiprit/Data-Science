    "    \n",
    "    `error: Argument 1 to \"add\" has incompatible type \"str\"; expected \"int\"`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Like assert testing, this is a good way to find mistakes in our code before we ever run it\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- Having to think about the types in our code forces us to design cleaner functions and interfaces:\n",

    "    \n",
    "    Here we have a function whose operation parameter is allowed to be a string, or an int, or a float, or a bool. It's highly likely that this function is fragile and difficult to use, but it becomes far more clear when the types are made explicit. Doing so, then, will force us to design in a less clucky way, for which our users will thank us\n",
    "    \n",
